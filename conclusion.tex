In this paper, we investigated the application of in situ reduction via Lagrangian representations for the Nyx cosmology and SW4 seismic wave propagation simulations.
%
For the Nyx cosmology simulation, we found that Lagrangian representations are sensitive to both the spatial and temporal sampling rate and show improved efficacy as the temporal sparsity increases.
%
For the SW4 seismology simulation, we found that Lagrangian representations can be used to accurately reconstruct the displacement field, in many cases for a small storage cost.
%
For both simulations, the percentage of execution time spent on computing the Lagrangian representation in situ was under 10\% in most cases.
%
Overall, we believe the two simulations considered and many others could benefit from the use of Lagrangian representations to enable time-varying vector field exploration.
