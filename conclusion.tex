\fix{In this paper, we investigated in situ reduction via Lagrangian representations for vector fields from Nyx cosmology and SW4 seismology simulations.}
%
For the Nyx cosmology simulation, we found that Lagrangian representations are sensitive to both the spatial and temporal sampling rate.
%
Notably, providing higher reconstruction accuracy when basis trajectories are computed using a high spatial and low temporal resolution.
%
For the SW4 seismology simulation, we found Lagrangian representations are inherently suited to capture the transient seismic waves and offer high data reduction options for a small loss of accuracy.
%
For both simulations, the percentage of execution time spent on computing the Lagrangian representation in situ was under 10\% in most cases.
%
Overall, we believe the two simulations considered and many others could benefit from the use of Lagrangian representations to enable time-varying vector field exploration.
