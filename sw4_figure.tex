\caption{Visualization of the displacement field derived from reduced Lagrangian representations near the epicenter using multiple isosurfaces. The ground truth is computed using 2000 cycles of the seismic wave propagation simulation. Although at higher data reduction factors regions of high displacement are underestimated, Lagrangian representations are capable of accurately reconstructing the overall feature structure.}
