\caption{Efficacy results for the Nyx experiments. Each violin plot shows the distribution of the particle reconstruction error for a specific configuration. While Eulerian configurations contain greater uncertainty as the value of \textbf{I}, i.e., temporal sparsity, increases, the Lagrangian representations increase in accuracy. For Lagrangian representations, we find high reconstruction accuracy relies on a high spatial sampling resolution as well.}
