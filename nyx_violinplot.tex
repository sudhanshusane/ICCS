\caption{Accuracy results for reconstructing the Nyx time-varying vector field using 4 Eulerian configurations and 12 Lagrangian configurations. The violin plots encode the distribution of the particle reconstruction error across tests. While Eulerian configurations contain greater uncertainty as the value of \textbf{I}, i.e., temporal sparsity, increases, the Lagrangian representations increase in accuracy. For Lagrangian representations, we find high reconstruction accuracy relies on a high spatial sampling resolution as well.}
