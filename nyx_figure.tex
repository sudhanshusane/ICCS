\fix{THERE IS A FORMATTING ERROR WITH VSPACE BELOW}
Pathline visualization of baryonic particles evolution in self-gravitating gas dynamics of Nyx simulation. Using 10,000 randomly seeded particles, we visualize pathlines over 300 cycles. To focus on regions where particles cluster to form dense regions, we set opacity of the pathline to be directly proportional to time. Thus, we are able to focus on clustering as well as provide context of transport toward these regions. Lagrangian representations are able to reconstruct the ground truth trajectories and capture clustering accurately when high spatial sampling is used~(1:1, 1:8). However, when using a 1:27 data reduction factor, some clusters are visualized less clearly.}
