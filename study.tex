This section provides an overview of our study. It is organized as follows: runtime environment~(\ref{sec:runtime}), simulation codes~(\ref{sec:simulations}), experiments~(\ref{sec:experiments}), and evaluation metrics~(\ref{sec:metrics}). %, and runtime environment~(\ref{sec:runtime}).

\subsection{Runtime Environment}
\label{sec:runtime}
Our study used the Summit supercomputer at ORNL.
%
A Summit compute node has two IBM Power9 CPUs, each with 21 cores running at 3.8 GHz and 512 GBytes of DDR4 memory.
%
Nodes on Summit also have enhanced on-chip acceleration with each CPU connected via NVLink to 3 GPUs, for a total of 6 GPUs per node.
%
Each GPU is an NVIDIA Tesla V100 with 5120 CUDA cores, 6.1 TeraFLOPS of double precision performance, and 16 GBytes of HBM2 memory.
%
Lastly, it has a Mellanox EDR 100G InfiniBand, Non-blocking Fat Tree as its interconnect topology.

\subsection{Simulation Codes}
\label{sec:simulations}

\textbf{Nyx:} In this cosmological simulation~\cite{almgren2013nyx}, baryonic matter is evolved by solving the equations of self-gravitating gas dynamics.
%
We derived the velocity field using the fields of momentum and density of the baryonic gas.
%
The simulation involves particles gravitating toward high-density regions to form multiple clusters across the domain. 
%
The distribution of high-density clusters and their formation is of interest to scientists.
%
To study the distribution, scientists currently perform statistical analysis of gas particle density at a single time slice.
%
We investigated the potential of reduced Lagrangian representation to accurately visualize the particle evolution and the distribution of high-density clusters using pathlines.
%
%
The Nyx simulation we built executed as a single rank using two CPUs on a single Summit compute node.
%

\noindent\textbf{SW4:} In this seismology simulation~\cite{petersson2015wave}, seismic wave propagation is studied using a fourth-order method.
%
The application simulates waves radiating from the epicenter through viscoelastic media. 
%
%
We used the 3D time-varying displacement vector defined at each grid point as input.
%
We investigated how accurately we can derive and visualize the field encoding displacement over time in two regions: at the epicenter and away from the epicenter.
%
The SW4 simulation we built executed using six ranks per compute node on Summit. Each rank was allocated a GPU for execution.

\subsection{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

For each application in this study, we organized our experiments to inform in situ encumbrance and post hoc accuracy. 
%
We considered four evaluation criteria (EC).
%
To inform in situ encumbrance,  we measured the execution time (EC1) and runtime memory usage (EC2) for in situ processing.
%
To inform post hoc accuracy, we measured the size of data artifacts (EC3) and the reconstruction quality of time-varying vector field data (EC4).
%
Next, we identified four factors that when varied produce the workloads we want to evaluate for our study:
\begin{tightItemize}
\item\textbf{Number of particles:} the spatial sampling resolution denoted using \textbf{1:X}, where X is the reduction factor. For example, a 1:8 configuration states that one basis particle is used for every 8 grid points ($\approx$12.5\% of the original data size).  
\item\textbf{Storage interval:} the number of cycles between saves and denoted by \textbf{I}.
\item\textbf{Grid size:} the spatial resolution of the mesh. 
\item\textbf{Concurrency:} the scale of the execution and underlying parallelization hardware.
\end{tightItemize}
%
Rather than consider a complete cross-product of options for every workload factor, we sampled the space of possible options.
%
Our goal was to provide coverage and allow us to see the impact of certain workload factors, all while staying within our compute budget.
%
For Nyx, we ran 18 experiments, with 6 informing in situ encumbrance (varying \textbf{1:X}, grid size) and 12 informing post hoc accuracy (varying \textbf{1:X}, \textbf{I}).
%
For SW4, we ran 11 experiments, with 7 informing in situ encumbrance (varying \textbf{1:X}, grid size, concurrency) and 4 informing post hoc accuracy (varying \textbf{1:X}).
%
The specific options selected are presented along with the results in Section~\ref{sec:results}.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
\label{sec:metrics}
We selected our evaluation metrics based on the evaluation criteria listed in Section~\ref{sec:experiments}.
%

For EC1, we measured the average cost of invoking the Lagrangian VTK-m filter through Ascent every cycle, \textbf{Step}, in seconds. Additionally, we presented the percentage of simulation time spent on data analysis and visualization, or \textbf{DAV\%}.
%
We used \textbf{Sim$_{cycle}$} to denote the average time required for a single simulation cycle in seconds.

For EC2, we measured \textbf{InSituMem}, the runtime memory cost incurred by every compute node to maintain the state (current position) of particles at runtime in Bytes.
%

For EC3, we measured the total data storage (\textbf{DS}) required on the file system and report it in Bytes stored.
%
In addition to I/O being infrequently performed, we observed that for the scale of study we conducted, Summit provided fast write times.
%
In comparison to performing in situ processing every cycle, we found the I/O write cost to be negligible. %at the scale we test.

For EC4, we considered both a statistical and qualitative analysis. 
%
For Nyx, we derived pathlines from the basis trajectories and measured the reconstruction error by calculating the average Euclidean distance of interpolated points from the ground truth~(precomputed using the complete simulation data) for each trajectory.
%
We visualized the distribution of pathline reconstruction error for every configuration using violin plots, and for a subset of configurations, the pathline clustering directly.
%
For SW4, we derived a field encoding magnitude of displacement over time from the basis trajectories.
%
In this case, we visualized and compared the derived field to the ground truth time-varying displacement field using violin plots and isosurfaces.
