\caption{Lagrangian in situ reduction cost per cycle for all in situ encumbrance experiments. The SW4 simulation executes with six ranks (each allocated one GPU) sharing memory on every node. The Nyx simulation executes on a single rank using all the cores of 2 CPUs on a single node. The legend includes concurrency and number of simulation grid points in parenthesis and both axes use logarithmic scales.}
