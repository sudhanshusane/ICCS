Although a large number of applications produce time-varying vector fields, many limit subsequent analysis to single time slices due to constraints on data storage.
%
In recent years, reduced Lagrangian representations of time-varying vector fields have been researched as a potential approach to enable accurate post hoc analysis.

This paper contributes the investigation of Lagrangian representations computed in situ for two application domains: cosmology and seismology.
%
%These applications generate time-varying vector fields that vary in nature to those previously studied.
%
Our study provides the first statistical analysis of efficacy across a range of spatiotemporal configurations as well as the first qualitative comparison of the technique to the traditional Eulerian approach.
%
By considering representative high-performance computing environments and integrating in situ infrastructure with the simulation codes, our study demonstrates viability using GPUs as well as CPUs.
%
In particular, we found that use of Lagrangian representations for data generated by the Nyx cosmology simulation are sensitive to both spatial and temporal sampling, notably providing higher accuracy as temporal sparsity increases.
%
For the SW4 seismology simulation, we found that Lagrangian representations can accurately encode time-varying vector fields for seismic wave propagation and offer strong data reduction propositions.
%
Additionally, we include results from a benchmarking study using an ECP mini-application that utilizes heterogenous compute resources.
%
Overall, our in situ processing cost to compute Lagrangian representations required under 10\% of execution time for in situ processing in 11 of 13 experiments.
