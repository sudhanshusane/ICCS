Although a large number of applications produce time-varying vector fields, many limit subsequent analysis to single time slices due to constraints on data storage.
%
In recent years, reduced Lagrangian representations of time-varying vector fields have been researched as a potential approach to enable accurate post hoc analysis.

This paper contributes the investigation of Lagrangian representations computed in situ for two application domains: cosmology and seismology.
%
%These applications generate time-varying vector fields that vary in nature to those previously studied.
%
Our study conducts a statistical analysis of efficacy across a range of spatiotemporal configurations as well as a qualitative evaluation. %comparison of the technique to the traditional Eulerian approach.
%
By considering representative HPC environments and integrating in situ infrastructure with the simulation codes, our study evaluates the viability of performing in situ reduction via Lagrangian representations using GPUs as well as CPUs.
%
In particular, we found Lagrangian representations for data generated by the Nyx cosmology simulation are sensitive to both spatial and temporal sampling, notably providing higher accuracy as temporal sparsity increases.
%
For the SW4 seismology simulation, we found Lagrangian representations can accurately encode time-varying vector fields for seismic wave propagation and offer strong data reduction propositions.
%
%Additionally, we include results from a benchmarking study using an ECP mini-application that utilizes heterogenous compute resources.
%
Overall, the in situ processing cost to compute Lagrangian representations was under 10\% of total execution time in 11 of 13 experiments.
