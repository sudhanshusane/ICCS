Although many types of computational simulations produce time-varying vector fields, 
subsequent analysis is often limited to single time slices due to excessive costs.
%
Fortunately, a new approach using a Lagrangian representation can 
enable time-varying vector field analysis while mitigating these costs.
%
With this approach, a Lagrangian representation is calculated while the simulation code is running, and the result is explored after the simulation.
%
Importantly, 
 the effectiveness of this approach varies based on the nature of the vector field, 
requiring in-depth investigation for each application area.
%
With this study, we evaluate the effectiveness for previously unexplored cosmology and seismology
applications. %, which have previously been unexplored.
%
We do this by considering encumbrance (on the simulation) and accuracy (of the reconstructed result).
%
To inform encumbrance, we 
integrated in situ infrastructure with two simulation codes, 
and evaluated on representative HPC environments,
performing Lagrangian in situ reduction using GPUs as well as CPUs.
%
To inform accuracy, our study conducted a statistical analysis across a range of spatiotemporal configurations as well as a qualitative evaluation.
%
In all, we demonstrate effectiveness for both cosmology and seismology --- time-varying vector fields from these domains can be reduced to less than 1\% of the total data via Lagrangian representations, while maintaining accurate reconstruction and requiring under 10\% of total execution time in over 80\% of our experiments.
