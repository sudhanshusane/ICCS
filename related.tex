\subsection{Lagrangian Analysis}
Within the vector field analysis and visualization community, Lagrangian methods have been increasingly researched in the past decade. 
%
In this paper, we focus on the use of Lagrangian methods to store time-varying vector fields in situ and enable subsequent post hoc analysis.
%
%fueled by temporal sparsity of data, i.e., simulations store data less frequently to avoid high storage costs.
%
In sparse temporal settings, Lagrangian representations are expected to perform better than their Eulerian counterparts. 
%
The key intuition behind this expectation is that Lagrangian representations capture the behavior of the flow field over an interval of time, as opposed to the state at a single time slice.
%
However, in addition to the frequency of temporal sampling, the nature of the vector field and spatial sampling resolution impacts the quality of reconstruction.
%

Agranovsky et al.~\cite{agranovsky2014improved} conducted the seminal work to evaluate the efficacy of reduced Lagrangian representations.
%
To maintain domain coverage, the study proposed the use of uniform spatial sampling to extract sets of temporally non-overlapping basis trajectories.
%
Sane et al.~\cite{sane2018revisiting} studied performance across a range of spatiotemporal configurations when operating using a fixed storage budget.
%
The experiments in these works were conducted in a theoretical in situ setting, i.e., files were loaded from disk. %rather than integration with a simulation. 
%
Most recently, Jakob et al.~\cite{Jakob20} trained a DNN to upsample FTLE visualizations derived from reduced Lagrangian representations. 
%
To generate training data, they first computed Lagrangian representations of a 2D flow field using a tightly-coupled integration with an open-source CFD solver on HPC resources and reported computation costs.
%
However, the grid size of $4\times4$ per rank used in the study is not representative of real-world applications.
%
Thus, the current literature lacks in situ encumbrance measurements in representative settings.
%

Lagrangian representations of a time-varying vector field can be extracted by adopting various strategies.
%
Sane et al.~\cite{sane2019interpolation} explored computing trajectories of variable duration and placement. 
%and consequently proposed a post hoc interpolation scheme to reduce reconstruction error by evaluating neighborhoods across interpolations.
%
Rapp et al.~\cite{rapp2019void} applied their void-and-cluster sampling technique to identify a representative set of scattered samples.
%
Although these strategies improved accuracy, they increased computation costs and are presently limited to single node settings.
%
To address scalability challenges of extracting a Lagrangian representation in distributed memory, Sane et al.~\cite{sane2020scalable} explored an accuracy-performance tradeoff and demonstrated the use of a communication-free model that stored only trajectories that remain within the rank domain during the interval of computation.
%

Prior works have presented research pertaining to post hoc reconstruction using Lagrangian-based interpolation schemes.
%
Hlawatsch et al.~\cite{hlawatsch2011hierarchical} proposed a hierarchical reconstruction scheme that can improve accuracy, but relies on access to data across multiple time intervals.
%
Chandler et al.~\cite{chandler2015interpolation} proposed a modified k-d tree as a search structure for Lagrangian data extracted from an SPH simulation.
%
Further, Chandler et al.~\cite{chandler2016analysis} identified correlations between Lagrangian-based interpolation error and divergence in the flow field.
%
Bujack et al.~\cite{bujack2015lagrangian} evaluated the use of parameter curves to fit interpolated pathline points to improve the aesthetic of trajectories calculated using Lagrangian data.
%
Lastly, Hummel et al.~\cite{hummel2016error} provided theoretical error bounds for error propagation that can occur when calculating trajectories using Lagrangian representations.

\subsection{Time-Varying Vector Field Reduction}
%
Although Eulerian representations have been shown to be susceptible to temporal sparsity~\cite{costa2004lagrangian}\cite{Qin2014}\cite{agranovsky2014improved}\cite{sane2018revisiting}, temporal subsampling remains the widely used solution to limit data storage.
%
Our study adds to this body of work by using temporal subsampling for comparison.
%
Multiple works have proposed single time step vector field reduction strategies while maintaining an Eulerian representation~\cite{lodha2000topology}\cite{lodha2003topology}\cite{theisel2003combining}\cite{tong2012salient}.
%
Although these techniques could be used to reduce and store data more frequently, they do not inherently address the challenge of increasing temporal sparsity.
%

In a recent large-scale tornadic supercell thunderstorm study~\cite{atmos10100578}, Leigh Orf modified the I/O code to use a hierarchical data format and lossy floating-point compression via ZFP~\cite{lindstrom2006fast}.
%
ZFP provides dynamic accuracy control by allowing the user to specify a maximum amount of deviation.
%
Orf stated that although ZFP is effective for scalar fields that do not require differentiation during post hoc analysis, only a very small value of deviation can be chosen for each component of velocity to maintain accurate time-varying vector field reconstruction. 
%
Thus, ZFP allowed a limited amount of compression to vector field data without introducing significant uncertainty to post hoc analysis. 
%
The technique provided an average reduction of 30\% of total uncompressed vector field data, with regions of high gradient resulting in less compression. 
%
Overall, Orf referred to the use of lossy compression as unfortunate but necessary.
